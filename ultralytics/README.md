<summary>Install</summary>

Pip install the ultralytics package including all [requirements](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/requirements.txt) in a [**Python>=3.8**](https://www.python.org/) environment with [**PyTorch>=1.8**](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/ultralytics.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/ultralytics) [![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/ultralytics)](https://pepy.tech/project/ultralytics)

```bash
pip install ultralytics
```

For alternative installation methods including [Conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ultralytics), [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/ultralytics/ultralytics), and Git, please refer to the [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.ultralytics.com/quickstart).

<summary>Usage</summary>

#### CLI

YOLOv8 may be used directly in the Command Line Interface (CLI) with a `yolo` command:

```bash
yolo predict model=yolov8n.pt source='https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg'
```

`yolo` can be used for a variety of tasks and modes and accepts additional arguments, i.e. `imgsz=640`. See the YOLOv8 [CLI Docs](https://docs.ultralytics.com/usage/cli) for examples.

#### Python

YOLOv8 may also be used directly in a Python environment, and accepts the same [arguments](https://docs.ultralytics.com/usage/cfg/) as in the CLI example above:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a model
model = YOLO("yolov8n.yaml")  # build a new model from scratch
model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")  # load a pretrained model (recommended for training)

# Use the model
model.train(data="coco128.yaml", epochs=3)  # train the model
metrics = model.val()  # evaluate model performance on the validation set
results = model("https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg")  # predict on an image
path = model.export(format="onnx")  # export the model to ONNX format
```

[Models](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/tree/main/ultralytics/cfg/models) download automatically from the latest Ultralytics [release](https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases). See YOLOv8 [Python Docs](https://docs.ultralytics.com/usage/python) for more examples.
